### Kickass-torrent Daily Stats

Kickass torrents makes public data available in their api.  They allow a 24 hour dump and full data dump to be downloaded to the public.

You can find the Kickass data export [here](https://https://kickass.to/api/).

#### This project is retired ... cuz ... kickass is no longer operational

[https://www.shinyapps.io/](https://www.shinyapps.io/) is a statistical plotting service run by RStudio.

We can plot the histogram of all torrents uploaded on Kickass for the past 24 hours.

Well ... looks like kickass restricted their access to their API :( ... making this little fun project go defunct.  Spoiler alert ... there was a *lot* of porn.

The application in this repository can be seen [here](http://bnngj.shinyapps.io/kickAss).
